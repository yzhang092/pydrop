File transfer from server to server

Requirement:

2.  On one of the servers, over the course of 10 minutes, generate 100 binary files of random sizes ranging from 1kb to 1Mb at random time intervals ranging from 1ms to 1s, encoded int16.
3.  Transfer those binary files as they are being generated from the first server to the second server over HTTP using Python's async io functionality, thereby effectively implementing data streaming from one server to the other.
